# Board-game AI Bot Study
Personal explorations in the field of creating a ML AI that plays boardgames. Mainly dedicated to personal learning.

## Idea
The idea for this project was initally set by my application to a Game AI PhD in the UK that would have followed a similar project. I decided I want to make at least some explorations into the field on my own.

## Roadmap
The initial objectives of the project is to create a bot that learns to play the game Ticket to Ride by itself. The approach I plan to use initially is a MCTS algorithm. I also intend to explore Neural Networks.

The first milestone is to create a representation of the game Ticket to Ride (in particular its Germany version, simply cause that is the one I own and have played constantly)

The second one is to make it possible to play using commands that are easy to provide by an automatic bot. Success will mean a human player can play the game in its entirety using only text commands and would be able to see a representation of the game

Third one is to manually create a bot to play the game, however badly that bot plays. This will be done roughly and should not take too much time.

Finally, and what will probably take the most amount of time, I will research and implement solutions to make the bot learn the game by itself and measure its success.

## Technology stack
Initially I plan to use Python simply cause I am comfortable with the language and most ML and AI tools have an extensive integration with it. In the future it is possible that I integrate a Unity implementation into the project to make it more visually pleasing, but this is still in a very early draft.
